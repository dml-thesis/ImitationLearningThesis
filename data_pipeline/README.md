## File list

* `ref_vs_local.gif`: This GIF contains a single driving sequence, but plotted using two different frames of reference. The left portion of the GIF uses the Ref coordinate system, while the right portion uses the Local coordinate system. As you can see, the Ref coordinate system shows the red ego-vehicle moving with respect to the static lanes. On the other hand, in the Local coordinate system, we have the lanes moving with respect to the static ego-vehicle.

* `augment_decel.gif`: This GIF contains an example of a driving sequence being augmented with deceleration scenario. The left part shows the original sequence from the collected data. The right part shows the same sequence after augmentation has been performed.
